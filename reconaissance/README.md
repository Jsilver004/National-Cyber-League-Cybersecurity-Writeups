# Reconaissance

## Objective 

Perform network reconnaissance to indentify exposed services, enumerate open ports, and gather information about the target host.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network reconaissance
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration
- Nmap
- Banner Analysis

## Tools
- Nmap
- Kali Linux

## Methodology

## Problem 1

### Step 1 - Scan the Target

An Nmap scan was performed against the target host to identify open TCP ports and the services listening on those ports

(SS)

### Step 2 - Enumerate Services

The scan results were analyzed to determine which services were exposed. Service banners and versions information provided insight into the operating system and applications running on the target

(SS)

### Step 3 - Assess Attack Surface

The identified services were evaluated to determine potential attack vectors. Open ports and exposed applications were reviewed to understand what information an attacker could gather during the reconaissance phase.

## Findings
- Indentifed lowest/hightest open TCP ports
- Enumerate all exposed services on the target
- Recognize Samba services through service detection
- Demonstrated how reconnaissance can reveal valuable information before exploitation begins

## Takeaways
- Reconaissance is often the first stage of an attack
- Port scanning provides valuable insight into a system's exposed services
- Service enumeration helps identify potential vulnerabilities and attack paths
- Reconaissance can reveal significant information about a target environment
